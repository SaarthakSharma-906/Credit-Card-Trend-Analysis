# Credit Card Defaul Risk Analysis






## Problem Statement

A card issuing bank has faced challenges due to over-issuance of credit cards, leading to heavy debts and a decline in consumer finance confidence. The bank aims to analyze the risk of default among its customers to improve risk control measures.
## Data Description
The dataset includes 23 variables, such as credit amount, gender, education, marital status, age, and history of past payments. The response variable is a binary indicator of default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0). The dataset spans from April to September 2005.
## Analytics tasks

1. Trend Analysis: Analyze the trend in outstanding amounts for the bank.
2. Relationship Analysis: Explore the relationship between outstanding amounts/trends and variables like age, education, marriage, and credit limit.
3. Default Behavior Analysis: Determine if outstanding amounts/trends affect the default behavior in the next month.
4. Data Cleaning: Identify and clean errors in the dataset.
5. Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical techniques like EDA, Confidence Interval, Probability Distribution, and Hypothesis Testing.
6. Machine Learning Model: Build ML models using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier. Apply Feature Selection, Feature Scaling, and Label Encoding Techniques.
## Methodology
1. Data Collection: Gathered dataset containing 30,000 records from April to September 2005.
